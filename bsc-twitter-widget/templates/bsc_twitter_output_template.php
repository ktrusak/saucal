/*
This is where I got stuck
I'm posting Twitter information and paramters common for a post request
but the header data doesn't really show anything a user would be interested in from twitter

//$bsc = new Bsc_Twitter_Widget();
//echo $bsc->bsc_get_post_response - how do you want this prettied up?
//It is a pretty basic array of elements, to show header information

echo 'Hello world :)';
